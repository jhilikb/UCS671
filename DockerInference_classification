In your last session (Docker Inference) you had done the following:
Step 1:  Go to https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md 
Step 2: ssh into your jetson and on your jetson terminal type the following:-
git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
cd jetson-inference
docker/run.sh

a. Now that you already have a folder jetson-inference already on your jetson device , move inside it
cd jetson-inference/

b. Now run the docker using 
./docker/run.sh

When you did this in your last class, your docker was pulled. You can confirm that by typing "sudo docker images" and seeing an entry with "dusty"there.
When you run the same command in (b) today you will land inside the docker.

c. In your docker run the following 
cd build/aarch64/bin

d. You can run 
./imagenet.py images/orange_0.jpg images/test/output_0.jpg  # (default network is googlenet)

imagenet.py is a sample file prepared for a classification task. You can provide arguments "images/orange_0.jpg"   and "images/test/output_0.jpg" to it.
The first argument tells you what input image to perform classification on, the second tells you where to store output.

Questions:-
i. How do i copy the saved image back to some other location
Note that your docker mounts the following folders from your jetson
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/data:/jetson-inference/data 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data:/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/models:/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/models 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/data:/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/data 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/models:/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/models


ii. Can i take the input directly from the camera/video
./imagenet.py  jellyfish.mkv images/test/jellyfish_resnet18.mkv
./imagenet.py /dev/video0 output.mp4

iii. What if i want to change the classification model
./imagenet.py --network=resnet-18 images/jellyfish.jpg images/test/output_jellyfish.jpg

iv. What if i want to make other custom changes in the file.
you can create custom changes in a copy of the imagenet.py file and run that
