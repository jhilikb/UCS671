In your last session (Docker Inference) you had done the following:
Step 1:  Go to https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md 
Step 2: ssh into your jetson and on your jetson terminal type the following:-
git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
cd jetson-inference
docker/run.sh

a. Now that you already have a folder jetson-inference already on your jetson device , move inside it
cd jetson-inference/

b. Now run the docker using 
./docker/run.sh

When you did this in your last class, your docker was pulled. You can confirm that by typing "sudo docker images" and seeing an entry with "dusty"there.
When you run the same command in (b) today you will land inside the docker.

c. In your docker run the following 
cd build/aarch64/bin

d. You can run 
./imagenet.py images/orange_0.jpg images/test/output_0.jpg  # (default network is googlenet)

imagenet.py is a sample file prepared for a classification task. You can provide arguments "images/orange_0.jpg"   and "images/test/output_0.jpg" to it.
The first argument tells you what input image to perform classification on, the second tells you where to store output.
