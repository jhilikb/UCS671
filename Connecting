🔬 Experiment 1: Connecting to Jetson Nano
Step 1: Open a terminal on your Ubuntu host and type
ssh nvidia@192.168.55.1

✔️ Successful login indicates proper connectivity.

Problems:-
 keygen issues:   Delete the key and login again. This is caused if you connect different jetsons on your host.


Questions:
1. What if I connect with ssh 192.168.55.1?
It will use the username of my host machine (say csed) and try to log me in at csed@192.168.55.1
If the account doesnt exist on jetson,i will get an error

2. How do I transfer data between jetson and my host laptop?
Use the following on the laptop terminal to copy from jetson to laptop
scp nvidia@192.168.55.1:/home/nvidia/data ./

Use the following on the laptop terminal to copy from laptop to jetson
scp ./data nvidia@192.168.55.1:/home/nvidia/
