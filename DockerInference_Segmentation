Similar to detection and classification, you can also run segmentation models to perform image segmentation tasks.
Same as before 
a. Move inside jetson-inference on your jetson device
cd jetson-inference/

b. Now run the docker using 
./docker/run.sh

c. In your docker run the following 
cd build/aarch64/bin


You can refer https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/segnet-console-2.md#segmenting-images-from-the-command-line  and get started.
For example you run the following to perform segmentation on an image "images/city_0.jpg" and save the output in "images/test/output.jpg" using model
fcn-resnet18-cityscapes
./segnet.py --network=fcn-resnet18-cityscapes images/city_0.jpg images/test/output.jpg
