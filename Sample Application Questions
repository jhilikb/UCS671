1. Your friend is filming a short movie and wants automatic camera effects.
If the main character enters the scene, the video should zoom in; if the character leaves, it should zoom out.
Formulate the CV problem and describe the models and steps required

2. Your just watched a movie where the main character is having a vision problem where he sees everything in "grayscale". He only sees a particular character in color
Or any object which the character touches is in color. Can you formulate the CV tools to use for the effect?

3. Your younger sibling wants an app that changes the background of a video call in real time according to specific actions by the user.
Formulate the problem and explain how semantic segmentation models can be used to replace or blur the background on an edge device.

4. A wildlife researcher wants to monitor animals visiting a water source using a low-power camera system.
Design a deep learning–based solution to detect and classify animals while minimizing energy consumption. Explain your choice of models and edge deployment strategy.

5. A character in a movie can “highlight” objects he is thinking about — those objects glow while the rest of the scene stays normal.
Design a vision system where an object of interest becomes highlighted when the character points at it. Explain the models and inference steps. Further 
add effects where the center of the frame is clear while the edges become distorted.

6. In a thriller movie, the camera shows only silhouettes other than the main character, while the actual people are invisible.
Formulate a vision pipeline that removes people from the scene but keeps their silhouettes.

7. In a movie montage, whenever the scene has two characters the scene slowly zooms in and the background darkens.
Formulate the problem and describe the CV tools required to detect this interaction and trigger effects.

8. In a surreal movie scene, reflections in mirrors show a delayed version of the character’s movements.
Formulate a vision-based solution that detects mirrors and applies a time-shifted reflection effect.

9. Can you develop a game where clues appear as glowing symbols only when the camera points at the correct location.
Formulate a computer vision approach to detect specific regions or objects and overlay virtual symbols in real time using a sequence of frames.
