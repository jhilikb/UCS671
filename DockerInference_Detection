In your last session (Docker Inference) you had done the following:
Step 1:  Go to https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md 
Step 2: ssh into your jetson and on your jetson terminal type the following:-
git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
cd jetson-inference
docker/run.sh

a. Now that you already have a folder jetson-inference already on your jetson device , move inside it
cd jetson-inference/

b. Now run the docker using 
./docker/run.sh

When you did this in your last class, your docker was pulled. You can confirm that by typing "sudo docker images" and seeing an entry with "dusty"there.
When you run the same command in (b) today you will land inside the docker.

c. In your docker run the following 
cd build/aarch64/bin

d. You can run the following for detection
./detectnet.py --network=ssd-mobilenet-v2 images/peds_0.jpg images/test/output.jpg  # --network flag is optional,ssd-mobilenet-v2 is default

detectnet.py is a sample file prepared for a object detection task. You can provide arguments "images/peds_0.jpg"   and "images/test/output.jpg" to it.
The first argument tells you what input image to perform detection on, the second tells you where to store output.

Questions:-
i. How do i copy the saved image back to some other location
Note that your docker mounts the following folders from your jetson
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/data:/jetson-inference/data 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data:/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/models:/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/models 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/data:/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/data 
--volume /home/csed/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/models:/jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/models
This means that if i save anything inside the docker in the "jetson-inference/data" folder, it will be available in the "/home/csed/jetson-inference/data" 
folder on the device
You can now see the files outside the docker, scp them on your laptop to open them.
Note that /home/csed is the directory structure of this jetson. You may have /home/nvidia 


ii. Can i take the input directly from the camera/video
./detectnet.py pedestrians.mp4 images/test/pedestrians_ssd.mp4

iii. What if i want to change the model, put the model you want in the network argument
./detectnet.py --network=xxx images/peds_0.jpg images/test/output.jpg 

iv. What if i want to process a lot of images in one go.
./detectnet.py "images/peds_*.jpg" images/test/peds_output_%i.jpg

v. I observe that when i run the docker i land in "root@csed-desktop:/jetson-inference#" i.e. /jetson-inference folder, why?
The person who build the docker (not you, you are just pulling a readymade docker) had set WORKDIR in the last line of his Dockerfile. 
This will force the docker to land in that path while running. 
Can I change it?
Yes you have to rebuild the docker, write your own Dockerfile, use FROM to bring the already existing one, make other changes, set WORKDIR at the end
and then build it(sudo docker build .....). But remember it doesnt make sense to do this just for changing a landing directory. 


Notes: If your detectnet is giving you lib errors, check in your /usr/local folder on your jetson (after exiting docker). See if cuda is there. 
If not install it using 
sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit-10-2
You also need to install cudnn (you can check that
