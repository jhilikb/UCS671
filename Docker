🔬 Experiment 2: Verifying Docker Installation

What is a Docker?
Think of it like an environment where all software, code and data can exist. 
For clarity think of the following analogy: - Oracle Virtual Box ( docker ), You can have Ubuntu24, Fedora, Redhat running separately.
These are like docker images. Each is like a separate machine with their isolated environment, data etc.
When you run any of these, the running instance is a container.

Step 1: Check Docker images
sudo docker images

Case A: Docker daemon error
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
Is the docker daemon running?
This indicates Docker data is located on an SD card that is not mounted.

Case B: Docker works normally
If sudo docker images returns a list or an empty table without errors

🔬 Experiment 3: Mounting SD Card for Docker (Only if Case A occurs)
Step 1: Mount the SD card
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /sdcard
Verify:
df -h
________________________________________
Step 2: Verify Docker folder on SD card
cd /sdcard/fol
ls
You should see a docker directory.
________________________________________
Step 3: Verify symbolic link
cd /var/lib
ls -l
Expected output:
docker -> /sdcard/fol/docker

Step 4: Restart Docker service
sudo systemctl restart docker
